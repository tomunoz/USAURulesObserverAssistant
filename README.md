# USAURulesObserverAssistant
Web app developed in python in conjunction with Google Gemini to help answer questions related to calls made and what the USAU Rule says about relative to the call made. The intent of this app is to provide a way for Ultimate Frisbee players to have a place to ask questions regarding specific calls made during a game and receive a response based on the rules. 

The use case would be such that a call on the field is made by a player and the player from the other team "contests" the call. They eventually reach an agreement. After the game, someone could ask this assistant about this call and receive a response on the ruling based solely on the contents of the USAU Rule. Another use case is for learning about the rules by asking different questions and seeing the response to their scenario.

Like any use of AI, user beware as the AI may provide inaccurate responses. Always refer to the official USAU Rules.

This app was developed as a learning experience on how to vibe code with Gemini, integrate with Gemini to receive responses, and deploy on the web.
